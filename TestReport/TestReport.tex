\section{Overview}

In this last section of our project, we wanted to get our project ready for usage by others. 
Therefore we first took a look at all the things we wanted to get finished before the project is being closed.
After we got a list of tasks together, we created issues on \gls{github} together with a detailed descriptions on what needs to be done.
This didn't just include bugs, but we also wanted to increase test coverage, remove code issues and set up some necessary things like a Wiki and documentation.
After we created this issues, everybody could assign himself the issues he wanted to take care of.
While doing so we also discovered some bugs.
For these bugs we either created a issue or directly fixed them and wrote them into the bugs-report-table.


\section{Statistics}

Python:

C++:

Test Coverage:	

\newpage

\section{Continuous Integration}

To ensure a high quality on our code, we increased the building process of our code.

When pushing a branch, not just the test are ran on \gls{travis}, but also we generate a coverage report that will be sent to \gls{codeclimate}.
This way you get a small overview on each pull request about the current coverage and the coverage on the newly committed lines.
Added to that, you can get a complete overview on the
\href{https://codeclimate.com/github/TheSlimvReal/PSE---LA-meets-ML}{CodeClimate Webpage}.

After a successful merge to the master, we also introduced two new deployment steps.
The first is that the wiki pages on GitHub are build again in case a change happened on this files.
The second step is that we generate a code documentation that is generated and uploaded to \gls{githubpages}.

\section{Code Documentation}

In the first phases we already decided to comment our code with the \gls{doxygen}-Syntax.
In the implementation phase we took good care in documenting our code properly.
The problem now was that everyone would have to generate this documentation for himself, which is a lot of work.

To easy things up, we added a deployment step, which generates this documentation and deploys it to \gls{githubpages}.

This way everybody can have a look at the latest version of the documentation only be opening a link.

\newpage

\section{Wiki}

We already collected some documentations for working with our project in the previous phases and decided to make them available in the \gls{github} wiki.
Because the \gls{github} wiki holds its own \gls{git} structure and we wanted to keep all our files in one place, we decided to integrate the wiki in our build process.

Therefore we created a folder in the projects root which holds all the wiki's entries in markdown files together with an configuration file.
This configuration file is used to dynamically generate a sidebar that holds a navigation for the wiki entries.
All the contents of this folder together with the generated sidebar are then copied to the wiki's git.

After this is done, the new wiki entries can be found on \gls{github}.


\section{Bugs}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|}

\hline

 Fault Symptom  & Reason & Fix  \\

\hline

Command line input with more than one space between arguments resulted in program crash &
Input string would be split into a string list which had empty elements that caused problems &
Changed the parameters of the string-split function for the expected behavior (remove spaces) \\

\hline

A corrupted configuration file caused the program to crash &
Errors that are thrown while opening the file were not caught &
Opening config file now happens in a try-except block and errors are reported to user (no crash) \\

\hline

Labeling or collection on operating systems other than linux resulted in crashes &
The operating system was not checked when using the labeling or collecting module &
Current \gls{os} is checked at start of module and wrong \glspl{os} are reported to user \\

\hline

Changing the size of the collected matrices was not possible &
User entered size parameter was not used in collector &
Removed static size declaration and started using the size input parameter \\

\hline

Default parameters are not correctly passed to the modules &
The configuration file had a wrong format and could not be read properly &
The configuration file got restructured and has it's default keys for each module \\

\hline

When not entering anything, the program crashes &
The command parser tried to access a element in an empty array &
Added extra check to prevent the invalid operation and displaying error message if check fails \\

\hline

Passing a not regular matrix to the classifier causes unexpected behavior &
The regularity was not checked on the received matrix in the classifier &
We added the regularity check to the classifier and a failure is reported to the screen is this check fails \\

\hline

Trying to open a not existing file in the loader results in a crash &
The errors when opening a file where not caught properly &
The loader now catches all errors and raises a IOException that can be caught when using the loader \\

\hline

Trying to enter different commands without setting the name flag, the program crashes &
There is no default value for the name, so no default value was set &
We added a method that sets a default name as a combination of a defaut name from the config file and the current date and time \\

\hline

The collector prints his own warnings &
numpy prints his own warnings in the regularity calculator &
Suppressed numpy warnings \\

\hline
