##  This class handles the training of the neural network
class TrainingModule:

    ##  trains the neural network labeled matrices

    #   @param neural_network_path path where are existing neural network is located if you want to improve one
    #   @param name under which the trained network will be saved
    #   @param saving_path path to where the trained network will be saved
